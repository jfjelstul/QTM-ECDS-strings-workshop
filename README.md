# QTM-ECDS Strings Workshop

This repository contains the replication materials for the QTM-ECDS Strings Workshop by Josh Fjelstul, Ph.D.

# Workshop Description

Participants will need a basic familiarity with R, including how to open and write an R script and how to work with data frames. The workshop will be interactive and participants should bring a laptop with an up-to-date version of R installed.

This workshop will cover how to work with text data in R. We will start by talking about how to import common types of text files (.txt files, .csv files, and .html files) and how R organizes and stores text data. We will discuss the difference between strings and factors (the two basic classes of text-based data in R) and best practices for using each.

Most of the workshop will focus on regular expressions, which is an incredibly useful tool for manipulating text data. We can use regular expressions to detect, replace, and extract text based on patterns. We will cover how to write regular expressions, including how to use meta-characters, sub-expressions, character classes, and repetition quantifiers. We will then talk about how to use regular expressions to create quantitative variables from raw text and to clean raw text for use in text analysis.
